## 🤖 Code Assistance Disclosure

Some parts of the logic (e.g., carousel functionality, form validation, login token handling) were guided by AI assistance, 
Book: Flanagan, D. (2020). JavaScript: The Definitive Guide (7th ed.). O'Reilly Media.

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

- Image media URLs were challenging to manage, and some images do not load or link correctly.
- The `post/index.html` page does not display dynamic blog post content as intended — due to issues with URL structure and post ID handling.
- Time spent debugging API/media issues limited polish on some layouts and features.

Despite this, all required pages are responsive, and core functionality is present and working.
